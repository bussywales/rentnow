## Daily start-of-day checks

1. Open `/admin/system` and confirm env/config signals are healthy.
2. Review `/admin/alerts` for last-run status and failed users.
3. Review `/admin/payments` for stuck payments and receipts pending.
4. Review `/admin/featured/requests` pending queue and stale items.

## Core admin responsibilities

- Keep discovery quality high (review/listing governance).
- Keep ops workflows reliable (alerts, payments, reconcile).
- Keep communication clear (product updates, help updates).
- Keep incident handling structured with reproducible evidence.

## Security baseline

- Never expose secrets in screenshots or issue comments.
- Use admin routes only for operational actions.
- Record reasons on every irreversible queue decision.

## Key links

- `/admin/settings`
- `/admin/system`
- `/admin/alerts`
- `/admin/payments`
- `/admin/product-updates`
- `/admin/product-updates/import`
