## Launch discipline

- Use checklists before toggling live features.
- Keep release notes and help docs updated in the same PR.
- Prefer reversible toggles over irreversible changes during launch windows.

## Queue quality

- Add clear notes for every decision.
- Use standard rejection templates for consistency.
- Keep stale queue backlog low to avoid trust erosion.

## Reliability mindset

- Treat webhooks as primary, reconcile as fallback.
- Keep idempotency in all replay paths.
- Monitor failed counts and trend, not just one-off incidents.

## Communication quality

- Publish concise product updates by audience.
- Keep help docs practical and route-accurate.
- Capture follow-up work as explicit tickets, not tribal memory.
