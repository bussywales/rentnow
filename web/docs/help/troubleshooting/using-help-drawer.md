## How to open guided help

1. Click the help icon in the top navigation.
2. On key pages, click **Need help?** to open contextual guidance instantly.
3. The drawer opens on the right and keeps you on your current workflow.

## How article selection works

- The drawer checks your current route and role.
- It loads the closest matching guide for that page.
- Examples:
  - `/properties` -> search and filters help
  - `/host` -> landlord/agent workspace help
  - `/admin/system` -> admin ops overview

If there is no exact route match, the drawer falls back to your role help index.

## Related links and navigation

- The top article is the current recommended topic.
- **Related articles** surface the next most relevant guides.
- **Open full page** takes you to the full help article route if you need a larger reading view.

## When to contact support

Use support when:

- the workflow is blocked by an error,
- verification or status is not updating after refresh,
- settings appear correct but behavior is still incorrect.

When contacting support, include:

- your role and current page URL,
- what you expected to happen,
- what happened instead and any error text.
