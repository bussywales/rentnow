## Listing lifecycle

1. Draft listing with complete essentials.
2. Submit for approval.
3. Activate and monitor enquiries.
4. Refresh content regularly (media + description quality).

## Quality controls before publish

- Minimum photo count and clear hero image.
- Description depth: amenities, fees, restrictions, nearby context.
- Accurate pricing and period fields.
- Precise location and availability signals.

## Demand capture workflow

- Use market hubs and discovery rails to identify demand locations.
- Keep one featured candidate listing per key location cluster.
- Track message response speed and viewing follow-through.

## Demo vs real inventory

- Demo listings are for sandbox/training only.
- Do not use demos to represent live availability.
- Production conversion should come from approved, active, real listings.
