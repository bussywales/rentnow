## First-day checklist

1. Open `/host` and complete listing essentials.
2. Add high-quality media and precise location details.
3. Ensure description clearly states rent terms and expectations.
4. Submit for approval and monitor review outcomes.

## Visibility rules that matter

- Listings must satisfy approval and active status to appear publicly.
- Demo listings are excluded from normal public discovery for non-admin viewers.
- Featured status boosts exposure but does not bypass core visibility rules.

## Where to operate

- `/host`: listing management, featured request actions, payment history panel.
- `/home`: workspace snapshot + discovery rails.
- `/admin/featured/requests` (admin only): request queue and decisions.

Featured requests and pricing are workflow controls, not automatic guarantees. Quality still drives conversion.
