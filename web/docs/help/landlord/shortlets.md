## Turn listings into bookable shortlets

Use listing intent **Shortlet** to enable booking flow on property pages.

Guest outcomes:

- **Instant mode**: auto-confirm when dates are free.
- **Request mode**: pending until you accept/decline.

## Host dashboard workflow

From `/host`:

1. Review **Pending requests** in the Shortlet bookings panel.
2. Accept or decline quickly.
3. Track confirmed stays.
4. Open **Calendar blocks** to review blocked ranges.

## Payout flow (pilot, manual)

- Confirmed bookings create payout candidates.
- Admin pays out manually after check-in date (or completed stay).
- Keep booking and payout references for reconciliation.

## Common issues

- **Cannot accept request**: request may already be expired or processed.
- **Payout not visible yet**: booking check-in date may not be reached.
- **Dates blocked**: remove conflicting block first (admin/ops support may assist).

## Success tips

- Reply to pending requests fast.
- Keep listing details and house rules up to date.
- Monitor check-in windows to reduce payout delays.
