## Quality beats quantity

- Keep fewer high-quality listings rather than many weak drafts.
- Refresh stale photos and tighten descriptions monthly.
- Keep pricing realistic for local demand conditions.

## Use featured deliberately

- Choose listings with proven enquiry conversion.
- Align featured duration with campaign windows.
- Measure outcomes (leads/viewings) after activation.

## Improve lead response speed

1. Reply fast with clear next steps.
2. Offer realistic viewing slots.
3. Confirm key terms before scheduling.

## Operational hygiene

- Archive stale requests and outdated notes.
- Keep payment references and receipts organised.
- Follow help updates after each product release.
