## Setup checklist

1. Set listing intent to **Shortlet**.
2. Open `/host` and configure **Availability and pricing**:
   - booking mode (`request` or `instant`)
   - nightly price
   - min/max nights
3. Use `/host/shortlets/blocks` to block unavailable dates.

## Managing incoming requests

- Open `/host` and switch to **Bookings**.
- Use the pending badge/callout to jump to booking requests.
- Review dates and totals, then **Approve** or **Decline** quickly.

## Best practices

- Keep blocked dates accurate to reduce avoidable declines.
- Use **request mode** when calendars or operational readiness are changing.
- Use **instant mode** only when availability is consistently reliable.
