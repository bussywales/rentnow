## Step-by-step

1. Open `/account/verification`.
2. Complete email verification and ensure it shows **Verified**.
3. Verify your phone using the one-time code flow.
4. Review which checks are required by policy (email/phone/bank).
5. Return to `/host` and continue listing submission.

## Common errors and fixes

- **Phone code not arriving**
  - Use E.164 (`+234...`) and retry after cooldown.
  - Confirm your SIM can receive verification SMS.
- **Verification status not refreshing**
  - Reload the page after completing email/phone.
  - Sign out/in once if status remains stale.
- **Bank verification marked “Coming soon”**
  - This means policy may require bank later, but self-serve flow is not yet live.
  - Continue with listing quality and approvals in the meantime.

## Success tips (Nigeria-first)

- Use the same verified phone number you monitor daily for tenant calls.
- Keep your listing profile complete (name + phone) to increase trust conversion.
- Pair verification with strong listing media (3+ photos) for faster review outcomes.
