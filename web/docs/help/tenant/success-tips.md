## Build better shortlists

- Keep each collection focused on one commute pattern or budget window.
- Save fewer, higher-quality options instead of large unranked lists.
- Add quick notes outside the platform to compare trade-offs.

## Win the first response window

1. Follow narrow searches so matches are relevant.
2. Check new matches daily.
3. Message quickly with clear viewing preferences.

## Trust-first decision making

- Prefer verified advertisers where possible.
- Treat “Identity pending” as extra due-diligence, not automatic rejection.
- Confirm terms directly before any transfer.

## Weekly routine (10 minutes)

- Remove dead listings from collections.
- Pause stale searches.
- Start one fresh focused search if inventory shifted.
