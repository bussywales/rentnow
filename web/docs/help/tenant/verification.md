## Step-by-step

1. Open `/account/verification`.
2. Confirm your email first using the **Open email confirmation** action.
3. Add your phone in E.164 format (`+234...`) and request a code.
4. Enter the code and confirm verification.
5. Refresh the page and check that required steps show **Verified**.

## Common errors and fixes

- **“Code not received”**
  - Wait 30–60 seconds and retry.
  - Confirm your number starts with `+234` (or your country code).
  - Check if your inbox fallback code was delivered.
- **Email still shows not verified**
  - Open the latest confirmation email only.
  - If the link expired, request a fresh confirmation.
- **Bank shows “Coming soon” or “Not required right now”**
  - This is expected for tenants. No action required.

## Success tips (Nigeria-first)

- Use your active WhatsApp/SMS number to avoid missed viewing messages.
- Keep your verification page open during code entry to avoid session timeout.
- Verify before sharing offers or deposits so support can help faster if issues arise.
