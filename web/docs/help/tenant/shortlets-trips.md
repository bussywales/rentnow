## Where to manage trips

- Open `/trips` to see all your shortlet bookings.
- Open `/trips/[bookingId]` for booking details and status guidance.
- From a listing page (`/properties/[id]`), use **My trips** after booking.

## Booking modes on listing pages

- **Request to book**: host approval is required. Your booking shows as `pending` first.
- **Reserve**: instant confirmation when dates are available.

## Trip status guide

- `pending`: waiting for host response.
- `confirmed`: stay is reserved.
- `completed`: stay finished.
- `declined` / `cancelled` / `expired`: this trip is closed.

## Tips for smoother bookings

1. Double-check check-in/check-out dates before submitting.
2. Use the trip detail page to confirm totals and booking status.
3. If a request is declined or expired, choose new dates and submit a new request.
