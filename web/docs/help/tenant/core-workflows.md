## Browse and filter with intent

1. Start with a city + realistic budget + bedroom range.
2. Use listing cards to compare trust badges and freshness quickly.
3. Open detail pages for only your top 5 options.
4. Save strong candidates immediately so you do not lose context.

## Collections workflow (shortlisting)

- Use quick save on cards for speed.
- Move serious options into named collections by purpose (e.g., “Abuja short commute”).
- Share collections with household decision-makers using the share link.
- Import shared collections into your own account when needed.

## Saved searches workflow (retention)

- Follow a search only when filters are specific.
- Keep names practical (city + budget + bedrooms).
- Pause searches that are no longer relevant.
- Use “View matches” from saved searches to jump back into filtered browse.

## Contact and verification workflow

- Confirm availability, rent terms, and fees before paying anything.
- Ask to view in person (or a trusted verified virtual process).
- Keep screenshots of key agreements for support escalation.

Never pay before confirming a genuine listing and direct viewing details.
