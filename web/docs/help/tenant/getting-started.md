## What to do first

1. Open `/tenant/home` and review your market defaults and recommended hubs.
2. Run one focused search on `/properties` using city + price + bedrooms.
3. Save at least 3 listings into `Favourites` or a named collection.
4. Follow one high-intent search so “new matches” can start working.

<Callout type="info">
Your search is global by default. Market preferences improve suggestions and copy, but do not hide listings outside your selected market.

## Account and safety basics

- Keep profile details accurate so support can help quickly.
- Verify listing details directly with the advertiser before paying.
- Use in-app messaging and keep records of dates, prices, and promises.

## Core pages you will use

- `/properties`: browse and filters.
- `/favourites`: private collections and shared shortlist management.
- `/saved-searches` (or `/tenant/saved-searches`): follow, pause, resume, or delete searches.
- `/help/trust`: trust badges explanation.

## Success checklist for week one

- Save at least one collection per location type (work, school, family).
- Follow 2 to 4 saved searches max; avoid noisy, broad searches.
- Review “new matches” daily and message quickly when listings fit.
