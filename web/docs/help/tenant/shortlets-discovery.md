## Where to find shortlets

- Open `/properties` and use the **Shortlets** stay chip.
- Keep your city or bedroom filters; shortlet mode works with existing browse filters.
- From home pages (`/tenant/home` and `/home`), use the **Shortlets to book** rail.

## Booking flow

- **Request to book**: host approval is required. Status starts as `pending`.
- **Reserve**: booking confirms immediately when dates are available.

## After you book

- Open `/trips` for your full trips inbox.
- Open `/trips/[bookingId]` to see status, dates, and totals.
- If a booking is `declined` or `cancelled`, pick new dates and submit again.

## Tips for better outcomes

1. Confirm your dates before you submit.
2. Check status in Trips before planning travel.
3. If your request stays pending too long, choose another listing to avoid delays.

<Callout type="info">
Manual payouts remain a host/admin pilot workflow and do not change tenant booking status visibility.
