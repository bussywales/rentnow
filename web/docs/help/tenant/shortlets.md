## Where to find shortlets

- Open `/shortlets` for the dedicated shortlet browse page.
- You can also start from `/properties` and use **Open shortlet browse**.
- Shortlet listings show a booking panel on the listing detail page.

## Booking widget (property page)

Each shortlet listing includes:

- Check-in and check-out date selection
- Availability check
- Price breakdown (nightly, cleaning fee, deposit, total)
- Clear call to action:
  - **Book now** for instant mode
  - **Request to book** for host approval mode

## Booking status flow

1. Open a shortlet listing and select valid dates.
2. Pick dates and review the total.
3. Submit booking via **Book now** or **Request to book**.
4. Track outcome:
   - **Confirmed**: stay is reserved.
   - **Pending**: waiting for host response.
   - **Declined/Expired**: request closes.
   - **Cancelled**: booking was cancelled by guest/host/admin.

## Manage bookings

- Open `/tenant/bookings` to see:
  - upcoming + pending bookings
  - past bookings
  - cancel actions for pending/confirmed bookings

## Common issues and fixes

- **Dates unavailable**: pick different dates or reduce nights.
- **Minimum nights not met**: increase duration to listing minimum.
- **Request expired**: host did not approve in time; create a new request.
- **Cannot cancel**: only pending/confirmed bookings can be cancelled.

## Tips for better outcomes

- Submit complete requests with realistic dates.
- Prefer listings with clear check-in/check-out times.
- Keep booking IDs for support escalations.
