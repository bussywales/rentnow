## Bookable shortlets (pilot)

Shortlet listings now show a booking panel on the property page with:

- Check-in and check-out date selection
- Availability check
- Price breakdown (nightly, cleaning fee, deposit, total)
- Clear call to action:
  - **Book now** for instant mode
  - **Request to book** for host approval mode

## How booking works

1. Open a listing tagged as shortlet.
2. Pick dates and review the total.
3. Submit booking.
4. Track outcome:
   - **Confirmed**: stay is reserved.
   - **Pending**: host must accept.
   - **Declined/Expired**: request closes; pilot marks refund-needed for manual handling.

## Common issues and fixes

- **Dates unavailable**: pick different dates or reduce nights.
- **Minimum nights not met**: increase duration to listing minimum.
- **Request expired**: host did not approve in time; create a new request.

## Tips for better outcomes

- Submit complete requests with realistic dates.
- Prefer listings with clear check-in/check-out times.
- Keep booking IDs for support escalations.
