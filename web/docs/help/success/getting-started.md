## Principles

- Clarity beats volume: focused data, focused actions.
- Reliability first: idempotent operations and clean rollbacks.
- Documentation is part of shipping, not post-launch cleanup.

## Weekly success loop

1. Review top workflows and current blockers.
2. Refresh docs and product updates with actual changes.
3. Remove stale queue items and unresolved edge cases.
4. Validate reliability controls (alerts, payments, reconciles).

## Role-specific application

- Tenant: shortlist quality + fast response to matches.
- Host/Landlord/Agent: listing quality + conversion operations.
- Admin: queue quality + incident readiness + launch guardrails.

## Outcome tracking ideas

- Response-time improvements.
- Reduced stale requests in queues.
- Lower support back-and-forth due to clearer docs.
- Faster incident resolution via better evidence bundles.
