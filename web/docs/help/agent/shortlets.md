## Shortlet operations for agents

Agents can manage shortlet requests on behalf of owned/delegated inventory:

- Review pending requests from `/host`
- Accept/decline requests in one click
- Track confirmed stays and booking IDs

## Operating checklist

1. Keep listing intent correct (**Shortlet** for bookable stays).
2. Review pending requests throughout the day.
3. Confirm dates before accepting.
4. Escalate payout questions with booking and payout references.

## Manual payout model (pilot)

- No automatic host transfer yet.
- Admin payout queue handles settlement after eligible date.
- Use references and notes for auditability.

## Troubleshooting

- **Request status conflict**: another action already processed the booking.
- **Availability mismatch**: overlapping booking/block prevented confirmation.
- **Missing payout**: confirm booking status and check-in threshold first.

## Success tips

- Standardize response SLAs with your team.
- Use concise decline reasons for better guest recovery.
- Keep shortlet calendars clean to avoid false availability.
