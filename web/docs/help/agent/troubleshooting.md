## Listing quality blockers

- Failed publish: verify required fields and media rules.
- Hidden listing: check approval/active/demo state.
- Low engagement: review title, cover quality, and price realism.

## Featured request or payment blockers

- Pending request too long: follow up through admin queue.
- Approved but not activated: validate payment status/reference.
- No receipt: check payment success + email routing.

## Saved searches and alerts issues

- No matches: filters may be too narrow.
- Too many alerts: narrow scope or reduce frequency.
- Missing digest: confirm alerts enabled and baseline window.

## Escalation checklist

Share with admin/support:

- user ID,
- listing ID,
- request/payment reference,
- affected route,
- exact timestamp and screenshot.
