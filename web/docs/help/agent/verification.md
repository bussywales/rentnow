## Step-by-step

1. Open `/account/verification`.
2. Verify email and phone before scaling listing outreach.
3. Confirm required checks are complete based on current policy.
4. Reopen `/home` and `/host` to ensure checklist items update.
5. Share listings only after verification markers are in a healthy state.

## Common errors and fixes

- **Verification code keeps failing**
  - Re-request a fresh code and use the latest one only.
  - Ensure number format is `+234...` for Nigeria.
- **Email verified but checklist still pending**
  - Phone may still be required and unverified.
  - Check policy toggles reflected on `/account/verification`.
- **Bank shows coming soon**
  - Continue operations; this status is informational until bank flow is fully enabled.

## Success tips (Nigeria-first)

- Use a stable business contact line that can handle lead volume.
- Keep profile identity clean and consistent across listings for trust.
- Include verification checks in your weekly portfolio QA routine.
