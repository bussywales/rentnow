## Setup flow

1. Confirm listing intent is **Shortlet**.
2. In `/host`, set:
   - booking mode
   - nightly price
   - min/max nights
3. Block unavailable dates in `/host/shortlets/blocks`.

## Booking inbox workflow

- Open `/host` and go to **Bookings**.
- Use the pending indicator to prioritize open requests.
- Confirm dates and totals, then **Approve** or **Decline**.

## Quality guidance

- Keep host calendars current before switching to instant mode.
- Respond to pending requests daily to protect conversion.
- Leave clear internal notes when declining for availability reasons.
