## Portfolio listing operations

1. Prioritize listings by demand market and quality score.
2. Publish complete, accurate listings only.
3. Use demo flags strictly for non-customer-facing scenarios.
4. Review status/expiry regularly to avoid dead inventory.

## Lead and message operations

- Route and respond quickly to high-intent enquiries.
- Keep message quality consistent with clear next steps.
- Track drop-off points and improve first-response scripts.

## Demand capture loop

- Follow high-signal searches for your key markets.
- Compare “new this week”, trending rails, and saved-search signals.
- Adjust listing quality/pricing based on actual match patterns.

## Cross-functional coordination

- Share clear context with admins when escalation is needed.
- Reference listing IDs, request IDs, and timestamps.
- Keep product update notes and help docs in sync with operations.
