# No Help Change Justification

Use this file only when code changes do not modify user/admin workflows or support guidance.

Add a dated entry for each PR that uses this exemption:

- `YYYY-MM-DD: <short reason why no help docs changed>`
- `2026-02-20: Shortlets URL/state and return confidence updates adjust behaviour copy without introducing new help workflows.`
