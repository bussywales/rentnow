Client pages now look and feel like a premium mini-storefront for each client.

What changed:
- Add banner and logo branding per client page.
- Curate and order listings with pinned highlights.
- Publish with optional expiry dates and richer client context.

Where to find it: `/profile/clients` and `/agents/[slug]/c/[clientSlug]`
