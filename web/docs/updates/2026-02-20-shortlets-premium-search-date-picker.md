## What changed

- Replaced native date inputs on `/shortlets` with a calendar-based date range picker.
- Added desktop popover and mobile full-screen sheet date selection with `Apply dates` and `Clear`.
- Added client-side invalid range prevention before search submission while keeping URL-driven `checkIn`/`checkOut`.

## Why this matters

- Makes shortlet search date selection consistent with the premium booking flow.
- Reduces invalid date combinations and improves keyboard and mobile usability.
