## What changed

- Decluttered the `/shortlets` top controls to keep Search, Filters, and Sort as the primary actions.
- Moved Saved-only, Display total price, and Search-as-I-move toggles into the Filters drawer.
- Added a subtle Filters activity indicator for active filters and view toggles.
- Updated pricing context copy to adapt when mixed-currency listings appear.
- Refined card calmness: single-priority badge, cleaner metadata, and subtler save-heart styling.
