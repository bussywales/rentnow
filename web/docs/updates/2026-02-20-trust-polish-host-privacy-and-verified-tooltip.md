## What changed

- Property detail pages no longer fall back to showing raw internal host IDs.
- When a host profile is private, guests now see calm privacy-safe copy:
  - `Host profile private`
  - `This host has chosen not to display their profile publicly.`
- Added a small `What does verified mean?` tooltip next to verified host badges to clarify Phase 1 trust meaning.

## Why this matters

- Removes trust-breaking internal identifiers from guest-facing UI.
- Improves confidence by clearly explaining what “Verified host” currently means without adding clutter.
