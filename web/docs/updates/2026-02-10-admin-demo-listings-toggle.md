# Admin demo listings toggle + filter

Admins can now:

- Mark or unmark any listing as **Demo** from the Admin Listings registry table.
- Filter the Admin Listings registry by demo status: **All / Demo / Not demo**.

Notes:

- Demo status uses the existing `is_demo` listing flag (same flag used in host/agent create/edit).
- Demo badge and watermark visibility are still controlled by platform settings in Admin Settings.
