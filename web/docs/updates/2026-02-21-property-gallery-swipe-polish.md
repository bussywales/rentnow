## What changed

- Aligned the `/properties/[id]` gallery interaction feel with the unified carousel behaviour used across `/shortlets` and property cards.
- Improved cross-device swiping consistency (trackpad, touch, and drag) while keeping existing controls and thumbnail sync.
- Added subtle slide-settle motion (reduced-motion safe) and fade edges on the thumbnail rail for better visual affordance.

## Why this matters

- Browsing images now feels consistent across discovery and detail surfaces.
- Better swipe/scroll confidence on desktop trackpads and mobile touch interaction.
- Cleaner visual polish without changing booking, save/share, or navigation flows.
