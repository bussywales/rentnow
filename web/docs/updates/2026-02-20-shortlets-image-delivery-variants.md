## What changed

- Added explicit `thumb`, `card`, and `hero` image URL fields to shortlets search result payload mapping.
- Kept existing image fields intact while tightening map preview fallback to lightweight derivatives first.
- Preserved all search, filter, and booking behaviour with delivery-strategy-only updates.
