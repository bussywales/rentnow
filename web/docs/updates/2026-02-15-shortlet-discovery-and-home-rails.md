What changed:
- Added a dedicated **Shortlets** stay filter on `/properties` via `stay=shortlet`.
- Added clearer shortlet card cues:
  - shortlet badge/state chip
  - CTA wording aligned to booking mode (`Reserve` for instant, `Request to book` for request mode)
- Added **Shortlets to book** rails on:
  - `/tenant/home`
  - `/home`
- Added new help guides for tenant discovery and host/agent shortlet setup workflows.

Why it matters:
- Tenants can discover bookable shortlets in fewer steps.
- Hosts and agents get more qualified shortlet demand via clear browse entry points.
- Booking intent is clearer before users open listing details.

Operational notes:
- Manual payouts remain unchanged in this pilot.
- No Paystack, referral, or cashout logic changed.
