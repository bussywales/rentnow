## What changed

- Mobile shortlets cards now keep a tighter, stable visual footprint so images and CTAs fit the viewport more reliably.
- Mobile quick filters now use a polished compact pill with a focused quick-filters panel for power backup, borehole water, and security/gated toggles.

## Why this matters

- Browsing on smaller screens feels calmer and more predictable, without cards feeling oversized or clipped.
- Quick trust filters are easier to access in compact states while keeping the interface clean.
