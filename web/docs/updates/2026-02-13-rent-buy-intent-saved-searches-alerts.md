What changed:
- Saved searches now keep your browse intent (`For rent`, `For sale`, or `All`) from `/properties`.
- Opening a saved search keeps the same intent mode instead of falling back to mixed defaults.
- Saved-search alert matching now respects rent/buy intent when counting and selecting matches.
- Alert email “View matches” links now preserve intent so the results page matches the alert context.

Where to find it:
- `/properties`
- `/saved-searches`
