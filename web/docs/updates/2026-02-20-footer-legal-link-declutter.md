## What changed

- Footer legal links are now consistent across desktop and mobile with a single `Legal` entry that links to `/legal`.
- Removed duplicate legal wording in the mobile footer so users see one clear legal path.
- About, Help, Contact, and Referral FAQ links remain unchanged.

## Why this matters

- Reduces footer clutter.
- Makes legal navigation clearer without changing broader site behaviour.
