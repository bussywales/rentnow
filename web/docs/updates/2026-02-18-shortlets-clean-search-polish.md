## What changed

- Reworked `/shortlets` guest controls so every state reads clearly as `1 guest`, `2 guests`, and so on.
- Reduced visual noise in result cards with one primary action and one trust/status badge at most.
- Updated missing-price copy to `Price on request` for calmer, clearer listing language.
- Hardened map camera behaviour so refits only happen on explicit user intent (search, search this area, or location change).
- Improved mobile ergonomics with safer map-toggle placement and extra spacing to avoid covering card actions.

## Who it affects

- Tenant: cleaner shortlet browsing with clearer search controls and less map movement surprise.
- Host/Agent: listings appear in a calmer card format with clearer intent on pricing and booking CTA.

## Where to find it

- `/shortlets`
- `/api/shortlets/search`
