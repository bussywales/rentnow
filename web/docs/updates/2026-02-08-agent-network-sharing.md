Agent Network Discovery lets agents add other agents’ live listings to client pages with attribution only.

What changed:
- New Agent Network Discovery page to browse live listings across the platform.
- External listings can be added to client pages and show “Listed by” attribution.
- Leads still route to the listing owner with attribution to the presenting agent.

Where to find it: `/dashboard/agent-network` and `/profile/clients` (Add external listings).
