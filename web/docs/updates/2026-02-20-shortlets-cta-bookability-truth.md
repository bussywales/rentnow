## What changed

- Shortlets search cards now avoid booking-intent CTAs when a stay is not currently bookable (for example, missing nightly price).
- Marker-selected map preview now includes a click-through CTA that follows the same bookability rules as the list cards.
- Non-bookable stays now clearly use `View` instead of `Reserve` or `Request`.

## Why this matters

- Prevents false booking expectations and reduces trust-breaking dead-ends.
- Keeps map and list surfaces consistent before users open a listing detail page.
