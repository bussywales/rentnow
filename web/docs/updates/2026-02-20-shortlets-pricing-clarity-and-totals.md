## What changed

- `/shortlets` cards now support nightly pricing plus date-aware stay totals when check-in/check-out are selected.
- Added a lightweight in-card pricing details peek to explain subtotal and total without clutter.
- Property booking widget now uses clearer request/instant CTA copy and confirms that users are not charged until the payment step.
- Date selections from `/shortlets` now carry into listing detail links to reduce re-entry friction.

## Who it affects

- Tenant: clearer price expectations from discovery through booking.
- Host/Agent: better conversion context and fewer unclear price questions from guests.

## Where to find it

- `/shortlets`
- `/properties/[id]`
