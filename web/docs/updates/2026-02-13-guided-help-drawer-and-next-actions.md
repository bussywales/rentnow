What changed:
- Added a unified contextual Help Drawer that maps route + role to the most relevant docs-backed guide.
- Added page-level **Need help?** triggers on key workflows, including `/admin/system` and `/properties`.
- Added proactive **Next best actions** panels on tenant, host, and admin dashboard surfaces.
- Expanded help drift guard checks so key feature changes require help docs updates or a same-day justification entry.

Where to find it:
- Guided help: header help icon and page-level **Need help?** actions.
- Admin workflow guidance: `/admin/system` and `/help/admin`.
