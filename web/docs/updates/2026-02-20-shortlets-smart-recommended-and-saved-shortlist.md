## What changed

- Improved `/shortlets` default `Recommended` sort with a trust-first score that prioritises verified hosts, better listing media, conversion-friendly booking mode, and deterministic tie-breakers.
- Added card-level save hearts with shortlist persistence in local storage and URL-driven `saved=1` view filtering.
- Added a saved-only empty state with quick actions to return to all stays or jump to a Nigeria destination search.

## Who it affects

- Tenant: more useful ranking by default, plus a quick way to save and revisit stays.
- Host/Agent: better exposure for complete, trusted listings in default recommendation order.

## Where to find it

- `/shortlets`
