## What changed

- Added a dedicated `/shortlets` search experience with a split list/map desktop layout and a mobile map toggle.
- Added availability-aware search so selected dates only return listings without booked or blocked overlaps.
- Added Nigeria-first trust filters: power backup, borehole water, security, Wi-Fi, verified host, and booking mode.

## Who it affects

- Tenant: can search shortlets by area/landmark, dates, and trust signals with map price pins.
- Host/Agent: gains better discoverability for shortlet listings through a dedicated search surface.

## Where to find it

- `/shortlets`
- `/api/shortlets/search`
