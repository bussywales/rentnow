## What changed

- Added a new `Display total price` toggle on `/shortlets` so guests can switch between nightly-first and total-first card pricing.
- Total-first view now shows total as the primary line with a nightly secondary line, while nightly remains the default.
- The toggle is URL-backed via `priceDisplay=nightly|total` and persists through map/list interactions.
- When dates are not selected, total display is disabled with a helper message to reduce confusion.

## Why this matters

- Cleaner price context before checkout.
- Better parity with familiar short-stay search behaviour while keeping pricing calm and transparent.
