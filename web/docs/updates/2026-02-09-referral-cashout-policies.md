What changed:
- Referral rewards are now explicitly positioned as PropatyHub Credits first, usable for PAYG listing fees and featured listing credits.
- Added country-level referral cashout policy controls for admins (payout enablement, conversion enablement, rate, minimums, monthly cap, and manual approval requirement).
- Added an admin payouts queue at `/admin/referrals/payouts` for approve/reject/mark-paid manual processing.
- Added a public referral FAQ at `/help/referrals` and linked it from dashboard/admin referral surfaces.

Important:
- Cashout availability is jurisdiction-based and may be disabled by default.
- Manual payout workflow is supported; no payout provider integration is active in this release.
