## What changed

- PropatyHub now remembers your recent browse intent (last search filters and recent hub selection).
- `/home` and `/tenant/home` now show **Continue browsing** when recent intent exists.
- `/properties` now shows a **Continue where you left off** banner on first load (no active filters), with a per-session “Not now” dismiss.

## Notes

- Search is still global; this only affects suggestions and explicit “Continue” actions.
- Listings keep their own listing currency; no conversion was added.
