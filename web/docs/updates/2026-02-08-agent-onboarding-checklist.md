The agent dashboard now surfaces Client pages and a lightweight “Get started” checklist.

What changed:
- Added a Client pages shortcut in the agent dashboard nav.
- New onboarding checklist helps agents create a listing, a client page, and share a link.
- Checklist auto-hides after completion and syncs across devices.

Where to find it: `/dashboard` (nav bar) and `/dashboard/analytics` (checklist card).
