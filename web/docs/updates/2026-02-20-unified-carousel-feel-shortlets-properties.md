## What changed

- Unified the image carousel interaction model across `/shortlets` cards and `/properties` surfaces.
- Standardized swipe/drag suppression so swipe gestures do not accidentally trigger card navigation.
- Aligned controls and accessibility semantics (arrow labels, count badge behavior, and shared control markers).
- Kept existing map/list, pricing, and booking behaviour unchanged while making carousel feel consistent.

## Why this matters

- More predictable interaction quality across discovery and detail pages.
- Fewer accidental taps/click-throughs after swipe gestures.
- Better consistency between desktop and mobile image browsing patterns.
