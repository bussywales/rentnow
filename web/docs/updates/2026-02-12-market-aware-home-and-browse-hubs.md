## What changed

- Home surfaces now use market-aware hub suggestions by default:
  - Nigeria: Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Ibadan, Enugu
  - United Kingdom: London, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow
- `/home` and `/tenant/home` now include a subtle **Start in {TopHub}** suggestion next to **Browse all homes**.
- `/properties` now shows market hub quick links only on first load (no active filters), then hides them once users apply filters.

## What did not change

- Listings keep their own listing currency.
- Search stays global; listings outside the selected market are still available.
- No FX conversion was introduced.
