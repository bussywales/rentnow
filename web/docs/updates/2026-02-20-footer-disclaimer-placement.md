## What changed

- Desktop footer now includes `Disclaimer` linking directly to `/legal/disclaimer`.
- Mobile keeps a clean primary row (`About`, `Help`, `Legal`, `Contact`) and moves `Disclaimer` into the `More` section.
- `Referral FAQ` remains available and unchanged.

## Why this matters

- Makes disclaimer access obvious without adding clutter to the mobile primary footer links.
