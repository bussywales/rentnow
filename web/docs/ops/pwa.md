# PWA Ops

## Installability
- Manifest: `/manifest.webmanifest` (generated by `web/app/manifest.ts`).
- Icons: `/public/icons/icon-192.png`, `/public/icons/icon-512.png`.

Verify in Chrome DevTools → Application → Manifest that the app is installable.

## Service worker behavior
Service worker script: `/sw.js`

Cached:
- `/_next/static/*`
- `/icons/*`
- `/icon.svg`
- `/offline`

Never cached:
- `/api/*`
- `/auth/*`
- `/dashboard/*`
- `/admin/*`
- `/proxy/auth`

Navigation fallback:
- When offline, document navigations fall back to `/offline`.

## Offline verification
1) Visit `/offline` once (to warm the cache).
2) In DevTools → Application → Service Workers, confirm the SW is active.
3) Set the browser to Offline and refresh a public page; `/offline` should render.
4) Confirm `/dashboard` and `/admin` are not cached (network error or offline page).
