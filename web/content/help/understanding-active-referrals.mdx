# Understanding Active referrals

## Invite vs Active

- Invite: someone joined using your referral link.
- Active referral: that invite completed a qualifying verified paid event.

<Callout type="info">
Tiers and milestone progress use Active referral count, not total invites.
</Callout>

## What usually triggers Active status

- PAYG listing fee payment (verified)
- Featured purchase payment (verified)
- Subscription payment where policy enables it

## Why this matters

An account can have many invites but a lower tier if few become Active.
