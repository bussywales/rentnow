# Creating demo listings

Demo listings are sample or training listings used to demonstrate workflows without treating them as live customer inventory.

## Where to mark a listing as demo

In the listing editor, go to **Basics** and enable **Mark as demo listing**.

<Steps>
1. Open the listing create or edit flow.
2. Go to the Basics section.
3. Turn on "Mark as demo listing".
4. Save changes.
</Steps>

## What happens when a listing is marked demo

- The listing can show a Demo badge on cards and detail pages when enabled by admin settings.
- The listing can show a DEMO watermark on images when enabled by admin settings.
- Demo listings are excluded from customer-facing promotions and related promotional surfaces.

## What demo listings are not

- They are not intended to represent real availability.
- They should not be shared with real clients as live inventory.

## Troubleshooting

### I marked it demo but I do not see a watermark

The admin **Demo image watermark** setting may be turned off.

### I cannot find the demo toggle

Make sure you are editing the listing **Basics** section, where **Mark as demo listing** appears.
