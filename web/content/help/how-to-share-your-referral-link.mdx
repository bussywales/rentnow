# How to share your referral link

<Callout type="success">
WhatsApp is usually the fastest channel for getting qualified signups.

## Recommended sharing flow

<Steps>
1. Open your referrals dashboard and copy your unique link.
2. Share a short message that explains the benefit clearly.
3. Follow up with your invite after signup.
4. Help them complete their first verified paid event.
</Steps>

## Good message template

- “I use PropatyHub for listings and lead flow. Join with my link and start faster: [your link]”

## Tracked links (campaigns)

Your referrals dashboard includes **Share analytics**. It lets you generate tracked links (called **campaigns**) so you can see which channel is actually producing:

- Link clicks
- Captures (signups attributed to your link)
- Active referrals
- Credits earned

On your first visit, PropatyHub may automatically create a few starter campaigns (WhatsApp, Instagram, Direct link) so you can begin tracking without setup.

## What are UTMs?

UTMs are simple labels added to your link (for example `utm_source=whatsapp`). They help you organize and compare channels when you share the same link in different places.

- `utm_source`: where the invite came from (whatsapp, instagram, direct)
- `utm_campaign`: a short name for the push (e.g. `feb-growth`)

You do not need UTMs for referrals to work, but they make it easier to learn what is working.

## How to know what’s working

On the referrals dashboard:

- Check **Funnel (last 30 days)** to see the last 30 days of clicks → captures → active referrals → credits.
- Check **Top channel** to see which tracked link is producing the most active referrals.
